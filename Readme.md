# AutoRclone: rclone copy/move/sync (automatically) with service accounts (still in the beta stage)
Many thanks for [rclone](https://rclone.org/) and [folderclone](https://github.com/Spazzlo/folderclone).

- [x] create service accounts using script
- [x] add massive service accounts into rclone config file
- [x] add massive service accounts into groups for your organization
- [x] automatically switch accounts when rclone copy/move/sync 
- [x] Windows system is supported

Step 1. Copy code to your VPS or local machine
---------------------------------
_Before everything, install python3. Because we use python as our programing language._

**For Linux system**: Install
[screen](https://www.interserver.net/tips/kb/using-screen-to-attach-and-detach-console-sessions/),
`git` 
and [latest rclone](https://rclone.org/downloads/#script-download-and-install). 
If in Debian/Ubuntu, directly use this command
```
sudo apt-get install screen git && curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash
```
After all dependency above are successfully installed, run this command
```
sudo git clone https://github.com/CyberPoison/AutoRcloneV2 && cd AutoRclone && sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
**For Windows system**: Directly download this project then [install latest rclone](https://rclone.org/downloads/). 
Then run this command (type in cmd command windows or PowerShell windows) in our project folder
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Step 2. Generate service accounts [What is service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts) [How to use service account in rclone](https://rclone.org/drive/#service-account-support).
---------------------------------
Let us create only the service accounts that we need. 
**Warning:** abuse of this feature is not the aim of autorclone and we do **NOT** recommend that you make a lot of projects, just one project and 100 sa allow you plenty of use, its also possible that overabuse might get your projects banned by google. 


Enable the Drive API in [Python Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/python)
and save the file `credentials.json` into project directory.

If you do not have any project in your account then 
* create 1 projec
* enable the required services
* create 100 (1 project, each with 100) Service Accounts
* and download their credentials into a folder named `accounts`

```
Note: 1 service account can copy around 750gb a day, 1 project makes 100 service accounts so thats 75tb a day, for most users this should easily suffice. 
```

The command would look something like 
 `python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --quick-setup 1`
 replace "1" with the number of projects you want to use (No News projects it will use existing onces)

If you have already N projects and want to create service accounts only in newly created projects,

to 

* create additional 1 project (project N+1 to project N+2)(Limit by google is 12 Projects by default)
* enable the required services
* create 100 (1 project, with 100) Service Accounts
* and download their credentials into a folder named `accounts`
 
run if you want new projects for each 100 Service Accounts

`python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --quick-setup 1 --new-only` 

#### If you want to create some service accounts using existing projects (do not create more projects), run 

`python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --quick-setup -1`

Note that this will overwrite the existing service accounts.

After it is finished, there will be many json files in one folder named `accounts`. 


Step 3. Add service accounts to Google Groups (Optional but recommended for hassle free long term use)
---------------------------------
We use Google Groups to manager our service accounts considering the  
[Official limits to the members of Team Drive](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7338880?hl=en) (Limit for individuals and groups directly added as members: 600).

#### For GSuite Admin
1. Turn on the Directory API and Admin SDK API following [official steps](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/quickstart/python) (save the generated json file to folder `credentials`) or enable it directly over the google cloud console.

2. Create group for your organization [in the Admin console](https://support.google.com/a/answer/33343?hl=en). After create a group, you will have an address for example`sa@yourdomain.com`.

3. Run `python3 add_to_google_group.py -g sa@yourdomain.com`

_For meaning of above flags, please run `python3 add_to_google_group.py -h`_

#### For normal user

Create [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/) then add the service accounts as members by hand.
Limit is 10 at a time, 100 a day but if you read our warning and notes above, you would have 1 project and hence easily in your range. 

Step 4. Add service accounts or Google Groups into Team Drive
---------------------------------
_If you do not use Team Drive, just skip._
**Warning:** It is **NOT** recommended to use service accounts to clone "to" folders that are not in teamdrives, SA work best for teamdrives. 

If you have already created Google Groups (**Step 2**) to manager your service accounts, add the group address `sa@yourdomain.com` or `sa@googlegroups.com` to your source Team Drive (tdsrc) and destination Team Drive (tddst). 
 
Otherwise, add service accounts directly into Team Drive.
> Enable the Drive API in [Python Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/python) 
and save the `credentials.json` into project root path if you have not done it in **Step 2**.
> - Add service accounts into your source Team Drive:
`python3 add_to_team_drive.py -d SharedTeamDriveSrcID`
> - Add service accounts into your destination Team Drive:
`python3 add_to_team_drive.py -d SharedTeamDriveDstID`

Step 5. Start your task
---------------------------------
Let us copy hundreds of TB resource using service accounts. 
**Note**: Sarcasm, over abuse of this (regardless of what cloning script you use) may get you noticed by google, we recommend you dont be a glutton and clone what is important instead of downloading entire wikipedia.

#### For server side copy
- [x] publicly shared folder to Team Drive
- [x] Team Drive to Team Drive
- [ ] publicly shared folder to publicly shared folder (with write privilege)
- [ ] Team Drive to publicly shared folder
```
python3 rclone_sa_magic.py -s SourceID -d DestinationID -dp DestinationPathName -b 1 -e 600
```
- _For meaning of above flags, please run python3 rclone_sa_magic.py -h_

- _Add `--disable_list_r` if `rclone` [cannot read all contents of public shared folder](https://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-cannot-see-all-files-folder-in-public-shared-folder/12351)._

- _Please make sure the Rclone can read your source and destination directory. Check it using `rclone size`:_

1. ```rclone --config rclone.conf size --disable ListR src001:```

2. ```rclone --config rclone.conf size --disable ListR dst001:```

#### For local to Google Drive (needs some testing)
- [x] local to Team Drive
- [ ] local to private folder
- [ ] private folder to any (think service accounts cannot do anything about private folder)

### Before beggining set up your .env more details on the .env file.
Run `rclone config --config ./rclone.conf` setup a normal google drive with client id and client secret from your google cloud console, and setup everything (You can skip the Team Drive part when asked, it will be not used for now.)

then get the required variables and setup the .env:.

```
cp .env.dist .env
```
```
vi .env
```
When all variables are setup please run the script.

```
python3 rclone_sa_magic.py -s YourSourceTeamDriveID -d DestinationID/YourDestinationTeamDriveID -dp DestinationPathName -b 1 -e 600
```

if you need to check all flags run `python3 rclone_sa_magic.py -h`.

* Run command `tail -f log_rclone.txt` to see what happens in details (linux only).

Actual Speeds.
